### Hi there :thumbsup: I'm Simon Wood.

I currently work as an MIS Technical Lead but my real love is programming and the problem-solving that accompanies it. I left school just after it acquired its first computer, but jumped into programming the following year when I built my Sinclair ZX81. The first useful software I created was a telex/RS232 communication system for the Commodore Pet, written entirely in 6502 machine code (yep, all in hexademical bytecode :flushed:). I graduated to the modern era with an Amstrad PC1640 in 1986 and haven't looked back since.
